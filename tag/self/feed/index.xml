										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="7c3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">People know who they have the potential to be.</p>
<h4 id="9ca3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The challenge is seeing that process&nbsp;through.</h4>
<p id="eee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Self-development is an art.</p>
<p id="943a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It takes time. It requires patience. It asks you to step outside your comfort zone. It is challenging — and that’s the point.</p>
<p id="5d47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, the biggest challenge when it comes to self-development is the process itself. People really struggle with the path and all its twists and turns, much more than they do any single obstacle.</p>
<blockquote id="4104" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><p>But should you learn how to walk that path of self-development, you will learn some tried truths to live by:</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="4fac" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote">1. Any failure can be reframed as a&nbsp;lesson.</h3>
<p id="ae9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Self-development is a mindset.</p>
<p id="d640" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To one person, a project going poorly or a relationship ending means they failed. To someone else, it is nothing more than another lesson on the path.</p>
<p id="43d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By reframing to see the lesson instead of the mistake, you will ultimately learn more and move on to what’s next faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="1760" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Compounding is the greatest mathematical discovery of all time.” — </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Albert Einstein</em></strong></p>
<p id="2159" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The quest to become a better version of yourself often feels like a roller coaster ride. It’s hard. And it’s usually so uneven. You can end in failure. But life is a journey, not a marathon, so you always have another opportunity to restart and improve.</p>
<p id="e925" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many people practically look out for secrets, tricks, and hacks that will make EVERYTHING better right now. But unfortunately life doesn’t work that way. There are no “overnight successes”. Think of all the incredible people you truly admire. They didn’t succeed becasue of one giant move, but rather a series of small and consistent actions over time.</p>
<h3 id="034d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Stop aiming for radical personal&nbsp;change!</h3>
<p id="5d95" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Be patient with yourself. Self-growth is tender; it’s holy ground. There’s no greater investment.” —</em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> Stephen Covey</em></strong></p>
<p id="421f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A magic bullet cannot save you! You’ve got to embrace the process and enjoy it. You can’t escape the hard work it takes to get better. Every incredibly successful person you know today has been through the boring, mundane, time-tested process that eventually brings success. So, stop looking for “quick hacks” that bring faster results.</p>
<p id="8ae3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of reading every self-improvement post for the one golden tip that will make you superhumanly efficient, focus on doing the actual work that needs to be done. You can inspire yourself to take action. The hard, long process is the only way though. You can’t achieve tremendous life success with a quick fix. Nobody gets it that easy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="a313" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure"><span class="graf-dropCap">T</span>here’s a paradox with self-improvement and it is this: the ultimate goal of all self-improvement is to reach the point where you no longer feel the need to improve yourself.</p>
<p id="2b09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Think about it: The whole goal of&nbsp;<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://markmanson.net/do-something" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">improving your productivity</a>&nbsp;is to reach the point where you never have to think about how to be more productive. The whole point of&nbsp;<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://markmanson.net/stop-trying-to-be-happy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pursuing happiness</a>&nbsp;is to reach the point where one no longer has to think about being happy. The whole point of&nbsp;<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://markmanson.net/relationship-advice" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">improving your relationships</a>&nbsp;is so that you can enjoy some drama-free cunnilingus in the McDonald’s drive-thru without almost crashing the car.</p>
<p id="3549" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">(Still working on that last one.)</p>
<p id="29c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Self-improvement is therefore, in a weird way, ultimately self-defeating.</p>
<p id="deff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only way to truly achieve one’s potential, to become fully fulfilled, or to become “self-actualized” (whatever the fuck that means), is to,&nbsp;<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">at some point</em>, stop trying to be all of those things.</p>
