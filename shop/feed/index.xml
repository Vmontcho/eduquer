					<description><![CDATA[I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Guess again. Bender, quit destroying the universe! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! I can explain. It's very valuable.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Guess again. Bender, quit destroying the universe! Ok, we&rsquo;ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we&rsquo;ll go ride the bumper cars.</p>
<p>Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Dear God, they&rsquo;ll be killed on our doorstep! And there&rsquo;s no trash pickup until January 3rd. Who am I making this out to? Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!</p>
<p>Say it in Russian! So I really am important? How I feel when I&rsquo;m drunk is correct? Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. I&rsquo;ll get my kit! You&rsquo;ll have all the Slurm you can drink when you&rsquo;re partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>
<p>Oh yeah, good luck with that. So, how &#8217;bout them Knicks? Anyone who laughs is a communist! Bender, you risked your life to save me! I suppose I could part with &lsquo;one&rsquo; and still be feared… It&rsquo;s okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</p>
