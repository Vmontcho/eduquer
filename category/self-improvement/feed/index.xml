										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="4ce2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">One of my favorite pieces of ancient wisdom comes from the Stoic philosopher Epictetus:</p>
<blockquote id="7dc4" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><p><span class="markup--quote markup--pullquote-quote is-other">We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we&nbsp;speak.</span></p></blockquote>
<p id="4492" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Sure, that may not be the&nbsp;<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">real reason</em>&nbsp;we have two ears and one mouth, but it reveals a useful pattern that we see repeated in communication in general.</p>
<p id="bcf4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Communication essentially has two parts: transmission and reception. These will manifest differently depending on the medium, but the general scheme is the same.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="3f10" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Textual Communication: writing and reading</li>
<li id="f9c7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Verbal Communication: speaking and listening</li>
<li id="4103" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Pictorial communication: displaying and viewing</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="636f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Simply Put, 2:1 Is&nbsp;Key</h4>
<p id="307b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If we expand Epictetus’s aphorism into a suggestion for how to more effectively communicate, we get something like the following:</p>
<blockquote id="e116" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><p>When it comes to communication, you should work hard to receive twice as much as you transmit.</p></blockquote>
<p id="5eb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">In other words, you should listen twice as much as you speak, read twice as much as you write, and pay twice as much attention as you receive. Let me unpack that last one a bit actually, as it’s a bit complex.</p>
<p id="76b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When around others, we can either be looking to get attention, or we can be paying attention to those around us. The difference between the two is just like the difference between talking and listening — though it expands far beyond the realm of verbal communication. It’s about your attitude as a communicator — your&nbsp;<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">purpose&nbsp;</em>for communicating. And a 2:1 ratio helps to remind us that we should be communicating in a way that helps to enrich us, and to build relationships.</p>
